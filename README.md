Given both open text reviews and ordinal numeric ratings on an AirBnB listing, can we use NLP  to predict ratings in each of the six categories (Accuracy, Location, Communication, Check In, Cleanliness, and Value), or do the results indicate a bias towards a higher or lower categorical rating? Of the three approaches outlined within this project, which yields the most accurate results and why?

Data was acquired from data.world:   https://data.world/bjblock/airbnb-chicago

Due to the Text translation and processing requirements for this project, each member of our team created their own Jupyter Notebooks.
They are named as follows:

McFarland: FinalProject_McFarland.ipynb
