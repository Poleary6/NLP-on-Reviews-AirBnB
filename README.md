Given both open text reviews and ordinal numeric ratings on an AirBnB listing, can we use NLP  to predict ratings in each of the six categories (Accuracy, Location, Communication, Check In, Cleanliness, and Value), or do the results indicate a bias towards a higher or lower categorical rating? Of the three approaches outlined within this project, which yields the most accurate results and why?

Data was acquired from data.world:   https://data.world/bjblock/airbnb-chicago
